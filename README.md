# Recommendation System based on Word2Vec

This personal project was part of a research on recommendation systems that use Natural Language Processing (NLP)
methods. This was basically a follow through of this [article](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/building-a-recommendation-system-using-word2vec-a-unique-tutorial-with-case-study-in-python-f02357fd2486) on medium, organized into jupyter notebook.


## Motivation
1. Apply NLP methods to recommendation systems
2. Use Word2Vec to learn vector representations for items
  - Apply distributional hypothesis of words/sentences to items/purchase sequences.
  - Based on result, recommend similar items

## Run
Run `Word2VecRS.ipynb` for full pipeline.
